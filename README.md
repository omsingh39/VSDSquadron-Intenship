Task 1: Performance Analysis of C Code Compilation**

This task involved analyzing the performance of a simple C program (sum1ton.c) that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n. The analysis focused on comparing the code size and potential performance when compiled with different optimization levels using the RISC-V compiler.

Lab 1:

* The C code was compiled using the standard GCC compiler and executed to verify its functionality.
* The code and output are documented in files starting with "Lab 1."

Lab 2:

* The same C code was compiled using the RISC-V compiler with optimization level "O0" (no optimization).
* The resulting object file (sum1ton.o) was disassembled to analyze the generated assembly code.
* The number of instructions within the "main" function was counted.
* The process was repeated with optimization level "Ofast" to observe the impact of optimization on the number of instructions.
* The results, including assembly code snippets and instruction counts, are documented in files starting with "Lab 2."
